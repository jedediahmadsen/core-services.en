# About data file and data sources for customer attributes

Data file requirements and multiple data sources for uploading customer attributes to the Experience Cloud.

You will need access to CRM or similar data from your enterprise. The data you upload to the Experience Cloud must be a `.csv` file. If you upload via FTP or sFTP, you also upload a `.fin` file. 

Customer Attributes is designed to handle a few files per day. To mitigate the issue of having a large number of small files delaying processing, files sent within 30 minutes of a previous batch from the same organization are routed to a lower-priority queue.

## Leveraging multiple data sources {#section_76DEB6001C614F4DB8BCC3E5D05088CB}

When creating, modifying, or deleting customer attribute sources, there is a delay around one hour before IDs begin synchronizing with the new data source. 

The Alias ID for each customer attribute source must be unique. If you have multiple data sources that leverage the same ID, they should be set up as follows: 

**In VisitorAPI.js or the Experience Cloud ID tool in dynamic tag management:** 

Set two customer IDs that will correspond to the appropriate data sources: 

```
Visitor.setCustomerIDs({ 
     "ds_id1”:"123456", 
     "ds_id2":"123456" 
});
```

(See [Customer IDs and Authentication States](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/?f=mcvid_customer_ids) for more information.) 

In the **[!UICONTROL Experience Cloud]** > **[!UICONTROL People]** > **[!UICONTROL Customer Attributes]**: 

Create two customer attributes sources using unique alias IDs corresponding to the customer IDs above. Using this method allows the same reference ID to be sent to multiple customer attribute sources
